# TechChallenge
This is a simple script that runs through a list of orders and checks to see if they can be fulfilled or not.

# HOW TO RUN
All you have to do is download it, open the folder in vs-code (or whatever IDE you use), right click and 'run in python terminal'.
You can also hit the 'run' button top right of the vs-code window while having the main.py open.

# Selecting orders
Make sure when selecting your orders you have it typed out like "1122, 1123" otherwise it will tell you there are no orders that could be ran.
